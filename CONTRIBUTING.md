## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so you only need:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Git for version control
- (Optional) A local web server for development

### Setting Up the Development Environment

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whatif.git
   cd whatif
   ```

2. **Open the project in your editor**

3. **Start a local server (recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server

   # Or simply open index.html in your browser
   ```

4. **Visit `http://localhost:8000`** in your browser
